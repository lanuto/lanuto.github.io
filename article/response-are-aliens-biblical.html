                Since you ask my opinion on this I would like to share.
                <br><br>
                I agree with John that there are other planets and that the Bible makes that clear. There is no reason Biblically or scientifically why we would not expect to see many other planets in God's creation.
                <br><br>
                I do, however, firmly disagree with John's belief of other <i>intelligent</i> life forms in the universe. There are many issues with this and I will name a few.<br>
                <b>1.) Are these other intelligent life forms under sin? If so, did Jesus die for them? Jesus is said to have only died for the sins of the world (singular, not plural worlds).</b> Consider this: God shows through the world (our world, not worlds) His eternal power and divine nature (Romans 1:19-20). He prepares some people for destruction and Hell (Romans 9:22). He prepares others for eternal life with Him (Ephesians 1:4). We are all naturally on the way to Hell because of our exceedingly grievous sins to a Holy and perfect God. A perfect and eternal God requires a perfect and eternal punishment toward the wicked (Psalm 7:11, Revelation 20:10). If there are other life forms that are intelligent, are they made in the imago Dei (image of God)? If so, why is there no mention of them in the Bible? Jesus lived the perfect life, died, and rose again from the dead for the sins of everyone who would repent (turn from their sins) and trust in Him <i>on earth.</i>  Jesus did not die on Mars. Or Jupiter. And to assume that He died somewhere far off in our universe would be to make a giant leap of uninformed faith. If Christians are not careful, heresies (beliefs that create a different and bewitched gospel) could result from such a belief.<br>
                <b>2.) The Genesis account specifically mentions God creating the earth and its creatures in six LITERAL days. We would surely be reading into the text to assume anything else.</b><br>
                God created the world in six days. In the good world God had made, both animals and people did not die. There was no disease, there was simply perfection in God's good world. However, even in this perfection Adam and Eve were able to disobey God according to their own free will. We do not have free will now, since we are either a slave to sin or a slave of righteousness (Romans 6:18). It is also important to consider that God even ordained Adam's sin in the garden by allowing it, although He did not make Adam sin. Adam out of His own choice decided to sin.<br>
                Either the aliens on other planets sin, and are therefore condemned by God without a savior--OR--the aliens do not sin and therefore live in a sinless state before God. <br>
                We did not evolve billions of years through random choice processes. If we did, then the Genesis account is not literal. If the Genesis account is not literal then we have no reason to believe anything in the Bible is literal! Death literally came before sin. Jesus also believed Genesis was literal when he refers back to God making people male and female (Matthew 19:4). Male and females did not evolve over time. It was so because God said it was so. In the beginning. There are many other reasons why evolution is completely illogical and undermines the gospel. I am happy to talk more on this if necessary.<br>
                <b>3.) The fruit of an evolutionary worldview is to believe in other intelligent life. It is not the fruit of a Christian worldview to believe so.</b><br>
                Evolutionists yearn with all their hearts that there would be other life. But the truth is, our world is finely tuned for life. God made it specifically and specially for us image bearers of God to live on. Unfortunately, we are stained by the sin of our first parents (Adam and Eve). Adam is the one ultimately held responsible for sinning and bringing the world (again, singular, as Romans 5:12 states) into destruction. Adam is responsible because Eve was deceived, Adam, however, was not deceived.<br>
                Christians have absolutely no reason whatsoever to believe that there are aliens. If there were aliens, well, God is allowed to do what He pleases. We must understand, though, that there would be big issues if there were--so I think we can almost certainly assume by the complexity of our world and the quietness of the Bible on the matter that there are no aliens. I would be <i>EXTREMELY</i> careful to ever state that you believe in aliens. Also ask yourself why you do. Why do I want to believe God left such a massive part out of the Bible? Why do I want my worldview to be more in line with evolutionists than Biblical creationists? Why do I want to potentially undermine God's special creation of humans as image bearers of God?<br>
                .<br>
                God describes creating the heavens and the earth. There are three heavens in the Bible. The first is the sky, visible from earth. The second is the universe. The third is Heaven, the place where Christians go when they die. In this account of Genesis, intelligent life is never described. God only describes making life on earth. The Bible never even hints at intelligent life on other planets, in fact, it does the complete opposite (the Bible makes it seem unlikely if not impossible). Intelligent life is even more difficult to reason than any life at all. At the end of the day, let us be silent on the things that the Bible is silent about. Reading into the text can lead to huge issues, even heresy if we are not careful. If you believe that there may be other intelligent life on other planets, please keep it to yourself. Lest, without knowing it, you end up preaching a different gospel than the one that the Bible clearly gives.<br>
                .<br>

            <p>
                I would like to share my thoughts on this. Dimetri, I see you put a lot of effort into this post. I will try my best to reply without typos then... :P
                <br><br>
                [ Everyone, feel free to ignore this if you want. ]
                <br><br>
                Regarding the matter of intelligent life, I think we should distinguish between intelligent <i>but not spiritual</i> life, from spiritual life forms.
                <br><br>
                For example: A lion could be said to be an intelligent life form. However, a lion also is not a spiritual life form in the same sense that a human or an angel could be said to be. Lions can think, understand the environment around them, form relationships, experience deep emotions, and so forth. But there is no real moral dimension to their actions, since they are animals. Thus, they are incapable of sinning. In addition, they cannot know Yahweh in the way a human would be capable of, since humans bear the image of God, and so lions are unable to do good to the level of humans.
                <br><br>
                I see no reason to assume planets other than earth could not contain intelligent, amoral (not to be confused with immoral) creatures. Why not? There is no reason there couldn't be trees on other worlds is there? So why not animals? Even more complex creatures capable of building civilisations are possible. These are aliens after all - they could think in ways we have absolutely no way of conceptualising. The real question is whether planets outside of earth have beings capable of moral reasoning, like humans and angels, since this introduces questions about the atonement, which you bring up.
                <br><br>
                Concerning which, I don't think the idea is a threat to Christianity. I am unwilling to assume things about this matter as I lack insight in this area. For instance, I wouldn't want to assume that the cross isn't able to cleanse a non-human of sin in case that's wrong. See also Colossians 1:20. But then again, the angels seem excluded from the atonement (though not because the atonement isn't powerful enough) as per the book of Hebrews.
                <br><br>
                Must a being bear the image of God in order for sin to be removed? What is the image of God <i>exactly</i>? I don't want to make assumptions about these things without seeking God first. Peter assumed that the Messiah wouldn't be tortured to death. This seemed very plausable, but he was deeply wrong. The crowd in John 6 ran away because they were carnally minded, and what Jesus was saying to them seemed like cannibalism. If they had asked God, they could have understood. We need to have a childlike faith. Things did not play out as people expected the first time Jesus came, and the answer turned out to be stranger than people thought. It will be the same the second time around, and it is unwise to come up with rules like "the Messiah can't come twice", "the Messiah won't be crucified", "women can't be disciples", "Jesus can't be the Messiah because the Bible says the prophet Elijah comes first", "picking grain on the Sabbath is unbiblical, so Jesus can't be the Messiah," which were all things I'm sure people thought the first time.
                <br><br>
                Not that we shouldn't be cautious... there are plenty of odd ideas floating around that are wrong and dangerous. Discernment is crucial. I don't want people to adopt ideas carelessly.
                <br><br>
                And yes, it is true that just reading the Bible doesn't seem tell us much about aliens. It also doesn't tell us much about the age of the earth for that matter. But why would it? I don't see how these issues are important. Just because they might be important to you or I doesn't mean they are important to God.
                <br><br>
                By the way, I find it interesting you mention evolution in this post, as if these ideas go along with one another. But in my opinion, the idea of aliens is actually not good friends with macroscopic evolution. If abiogenesis were true for example, we would expect it to occur within our local domain of observation once at most, given how unlikely it is. Imagine if millions of unrelated planets had life on them. How would anyone be able to defend the idea that life arose independantly on each of these worlds? People who believe in both evolution and aliens tend believe in panspermia, or that if aliens exist, reaching them would be infeasible, since the chances of evolution occuring concurrently in two distinct worlds is so low. It would take a great deal of fine tuning for that to happen.
                <br><br>
                I refuse guilt by association. Evolutionists do not own the concept of aliens, and it bothers me that for some people the only people they interact with who are willing to seriously consider the possibility are new agers, atheists, or the like.
                <br><br>
                Oh yes, and I object to something in point [2]: The idea that Adam and Eve had free will, but we do not. The account of Adam and Eve is the pattern for the disobedience of humanity that came afterwards. I can imagine us having free will and them, or neither us nor them having freedom. But it seems odd for them to have freedom, once, and us never again. Why is there an exception made exclusively for them and no one else?
                <br><br>
                Ok, there's likely more I could say, but I think that's enough for now.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for reading and Jesus bless.
