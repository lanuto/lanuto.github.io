                I have changed my views on this matter before. I used to believe in lgbt+ feminism many-genders etc etc. Later, I came to see problems with those ideas. As such, I concluded women cannot be pastors.
                <br><br>
                But I came to understand that I threw the baby out with the bathwater on this matter. I don't think any scripture supports that idea.
                <br><br>
                Galatians 3:28 (ESV) (Emphasis added)
                There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave[a] nor free, there is <b>no male and female,</b> for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
                <br><br>
                As distinctions between slave and free do not exist in Christ, nor does this.
                <br><br>
                1 Timothy 2:12 (ESV)
                I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.
                <br><br>
                Read the text here <i>very</i> carefully. Paul does not say that <b>God</b> doesn't permit a woman to teach; only that <b>he</b> (Paul) doesn't personally.
                <br><br>
                1 Corinthains 7:10-12 (ESV) (Emphasis added)
                To the married I give this charge <b>(not I, but the Lord):</b> the wife should not separate from her husband (but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife. To the rest I say <b>(I, not the Lord)</b> that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.
                <br><br>
                Paul here draws a distinction between God's commands and his own personal views.
                <br><br>
                And if women cannot be rulers, what about Deborah?
                <br><br>
                Can a women not teach someone how to be saved? How far do we take this idea?
                <br><br>
                As for your mention of the founding fathers... I fail to see the relevancy. You are not saying that women cannot be president only in America I take it. In any case, George Washington was a freemason. This is not a theory! This is a well-established fact, and freemasonry violates the Bible's instruction not to perform witchcraft. Anything that George Washington said I treat with the highest scepticism.
